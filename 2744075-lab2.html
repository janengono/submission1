            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project is about building a multifunctional mobile application for Metrobus customers. The app will allow clients to have a virtual card,
                this will enable customers to recharge their card wherever they are without the need of standing in long queues for hours. Customers will also be able
                to tag using their virtual card, without the need of any physical card. 
                Customers will also be able to see latest fares updates, and bus availability.
